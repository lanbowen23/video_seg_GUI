# GUI for 
Youtube link for the video demo is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMKvayBvqWA&feature=youtu.be  

The code uses python3 and tensorflow, basically just use `python main.py` then you may encounter missing package problem, 
just use pip install to install them.

Since the Models folder is too large, I have to use google drive to share  
download link is https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YMXhogwa-7LuaUVTIwbc4YZPS4vF8P4M. 
You need to download it and put it in the same folder with main.py codes.

I have two kinds of datasets prepared, one is the online dataset called YouTubeVOS lied in folder "youtube"; 
the other is taken in school lied in folder "Youtube2", use the data Button to choose the directory. 
Then use predict button to run the inference code to get the gif result we want, finally use show button to show them in the GUI.
